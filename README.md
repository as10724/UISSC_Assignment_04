#### Assignment task

Using sensor data from devices deployed in NYC and correlative data available from NYC Open Data, your assignment is to identify patterns and anomalies in environmental data, and find potential causal relationships between these indicators and the built environment. Air quality (particulate matter) and noise data have been posted to NYUClasses, along with locations of the devices taking the readings. 

Clean and plot the data for the individual sensors provided;
Describe the daily patterns that emerge;
Identify anomalous activity;
Link the sensor data back to city administrative records to identify possible correlations or causal relationships. -For air quality, you should examine the correlation between particular matter concentrations and temperature, humidity, and land use. -For noise, you should analyze the relationship (If any) between noise level readings, 311 complaints about noise, and land use.
